      <h1>NextGen Mysql Diff</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        NextGen Mysql Diff is free software, distributed under the terms of the LGPL license.
      </p>

      <p>
          NextGen is a command line tool meaning that it can be easily integrated into other scripts (i.e.: release management scripts).
          <br />
          There isn't a configuration file. Nonetheless, NextGen is totally configurable as you can use many command line arguments and options
      </p>

      <h2>Guide</h2>
      <p>
        One of the main design goals was to offer a total extensibility. The user can change and redefined anything.
        <br />
        There are three ways to extend NextGen:
        <ul>
            <li>creating brand new classes in the 'local' directory (that you can pass as command line arguments)</li>
            <li>extending existing classes in the 'local' directory</li>
            <li>redefining an existing class in the 'local' directory</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Why is NextGen a great tool for database change management?
        <ul>
            <li>it is totally configurable</li>
            <li>it is an automated tool but, by default, it may require some user interaction to advise about important decisions</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Available options and arguments</h4>
      <p>
          The <em>--answer</em> option is very important for create automated tests.

      <h4>Some important notes</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>Even if you are allowed to use two different engines for the two
              inputs, doing that may result in wrong outputs
              (unless those two engines are really hardcore!).
              You should always use the same engine for both the outputs.
          </li>
      </ul>
