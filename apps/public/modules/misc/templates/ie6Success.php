  <p>
  You are using a very old version of Internet Explorer that it is not supported by Plancake.
  </p>

  <p>
  We strongly suggest you should do either:
  <ul>
  <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/chrome">install the excellent Google Chrome browser for free. It is the easiest solution and it will take you just seconds</li>
  <li>or upgrade to Internet Explorer 7</li>
  <!-- we don't suggest installing Firefox because it doesn't seem to work on Win XP without service pack -->
  </ul>
  </p>
