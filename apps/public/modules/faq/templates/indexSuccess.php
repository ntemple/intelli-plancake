  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <ul>
      <li>
          <span class="faqQuestion">The mouse wheel scrolling does not always work - it is intermittent. How can I get that sorted?</span>
          
          The issue may be caused by the "SmoothScroll" Chrome extension. <br />
          You should uninstall that and install 
          <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/khpcanbeojalbkpgpmjpdkjnkfcgfkhb">Chromium Wheel Smooth Scroller</a> instead.
          <br />
          (Thanks to Warren for solving the issue)
