Hi. In this video I'll show you how to get the most out of Plancake,

0:00:13.100,0:00:15.000
in order to become more organised 

0:00:15.000,0:00:18.800
and take control of all the things you need to do.

0:00:21.000,0:00:23.500
You can watch this video again at any time

0:00:23.500,0:00:28.000
by clicking the video icon at the bottom of the screen.

0:00:32.800,0:00:35.650
One of the most interesting Plancake features

0:00:35.650,0:00:40.000
is the ability to load two lists on the same screen.

0:00:43.000,0:00:47.200
This saves you time which is lost switching between lists.

0:00:56.950,0:01:00.000
Now, let's say I want to plan an event.

0:01:00.000,0:01:01.600
I am going to create a new list

0:01:01.600,0:01:04.000
under the header 'Important projects'.

0:01:15.200,0:01:18.200
Headers (the labels in orange) are very easy to create

0:01:18.200,0:01:21.000
and help you organise your lists.

0:01:23.000,0:01:26.500
Let's add some tasks to this new list.

0:01:34.000,0:01:38.000
You can use some handy shortcuts when adding a task.

0:01:53.800,0:01:57.000
You can specify more details for your task...

0:02:00.000,0:02:03.000
...such as 'due date', whether the task repeats

0:02:03.000,0:02:08.000
and an additional note that you can even use for sub-tasks.

0:02:11.000,0:02:13.000
Each task belongs to a list -

0:02:13.000,0:02:19.000
- if a list is not specified, the task is added to the 'Default list'.

0:02:25.000,0:02:32.000
You can edit a task by clicking on the task itself or its 'edit' icon.

0:02:38.000,0:02:40.600
When you add a task you can set its position

0:02:40.600,0:02:44.000
to anywhere in the list.

0:02:51.000,0:02:54.200
You can also drag and drop tasks to reorder them

0:02:54.200,0:02:57.500
or to move them to another list.

0:03:08.000,0:03:11.500
Clicking the star button marks tasks that are important

0:03:11.500,0:03:14.200
or require extra attention.

0:03:18.000,0:03:21.400
You can see all your starred tasks by clicking the Starred button

0:03:21.400,0:03:26.000
located with the task filters at the bottom of the screen.

0:03:32.000,0:03:34.000
You can mark tasks as done

0:03:34.000,0:03:37.500
and reverse it if you make a mistake.

0:03:47.000,0:03:50.000
When viewing a list, you can find the completed tasks

0:03:50.000,0:03:55.000
by clicking the Completed filter at the bottom of the screen.

0:04:00.000,0:04:03.000
Another useful filter is the Calendar which allows you

0:04:03.000,0:04:05.700
to quickly see tasks due this week,

0:04:05.700,0:04:09.000
or browse to any other point in time.

0:04:14.500,0:04:17.100
Finally, don't forget to check out the guide

0:04:17.100,0:04:19.600
on how to use Plancake when an internet connection

0:04:19.600,0:04:21.300
is not available.

0:04:23.000,0:04:25.800
You can use Plancake on your smartphone too.

0:04:25.900,0:04:29.000
View the Mobile guide to find out more.

0:04:31.000,0:04:33.600
There are no apps to download or keep updated

0:04:33.600,0:04:38.000
and it works without an Internet connection on most devices.

0:04:40.000,0:04:41.800
That's it for now! Thank you

0:04:41.800,0:04:44.500
for viewing the Plancake video tutorial.

0:04:44.700,0:04:46.000
If you require any extra help

0:04:46.000,0:04:49.000
then please don't hesitate to contact us.

Happy Plancaking!";

  You can download Plancake and install it on your own <b>web server</b> but don't forget you can simply <a href=\"%s\">create an account</a> and start using Plancake for free without having to install, update or backup anything.

  <p>
  Plancake is a PHP5/MySQL web application built on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.symfony-project.org/\">Symfony</a>, the enterprise-level Object Oriented PHP Framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  To install Plancake on your server, there are some pre-requisites that are unfortunately <b>quite demanding</b> (please help us make the installation process easier):
  <ul>
  <li>the server has to run Linux</li>
  <li>MySQL database 4.0 or later</li>
  <li>Apache Web Server with mod_rewrite enabled</li>
  <li>PHP 5.2.4 or later</li>
  <li>you have to be able to set Apache Virtual hosts on the server</li>
  <li>you have to have SSH access to the server (if you don't know what that means, I am afraid you will not be able to install Plancake)</li>

    Plancake can be used in your browser even when an Internet connection is not available (thanks to HTML5). <br />
    That's simply because you can use the mobile/smartphone version also with your desktop/laptop.
</p>

<p>
    <img src=\"/images/offline_use_guide1.png\" />
</p>

<p>Offline support works very well on <b>Google Chrome</b> - some other browsers may not be supporting the new technologies we are leveraging just yet.</p>

<h3>Set up while still online</h3>
<p>
    In order to activate the offline support, you need to go to the Mobile version from your laptop or desktop <b>while Internet is available</b>: <br />
<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"%s\">%s</a>    <b>[you need to be logged in]</b><br />
After that first time, you can use the Mobile version (at that address) from your laptop or desktop even when the Internet is not available.
</p>

<p>
    The first time you reach the Mobile application (and after every time you clear your browser cache), your data
    will be synchronized and saved on your computer. From that moment on, your can use the mobile application even when offline. <br />
    <b>If you're using a public or shared computer, don't allow offline use.</b>    
</p>

<h3>How to use the offline support when Internet is not available</h3>
<p>
If you try to reach Plancake.com while you don't have an Internet access, the system will redirect you automatically to the Mobile version. <br />
Otherwise, if the Internet goes down while you are using the Plancake web application, you can switch to the Mobile application by clicking the icon shown below (you need to open up your \"My account\" navigation first).
</p>

<p>
<img src=\"/images/offline_use_guide2.png\" />
</p>
  
<h3>Synchronizing changes</h3>
<p>
Changes on the Web application or on the Mobile application are <b>not</b> synchronised automatically - just hit the 'Sync' button at the bottom of the screen when you are ready to transfer them.
</p>

<p>
To mark a task as done, you just need to long click on it.
</p>

<h3>Roadmap</h3>
<p>In the future, we would like to integrate the offline capability in the main web application itself, so that you don't need to change URL in order to use it.</p>

<p><b>If you experience unexpected problems, clearing the cache of your browser may solve the issue.</b></p>

      With Plancake Mobile we decided to go for an innovative route (by using HTML5) rather than building a native application for each smartphone operating system. <br />
      This way we can make improvements quickly as we only need to maintain one codebase, as opposed to 4 or 5 of them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
      What does that mean to you?
      <ul>
          <li>you can use Plancake Mobile even without an Internet connection and have a nice shortcut on your home screen, as with most native apps.</li>
          <li>you don't need to install anything from the app store - just need to visit www.plancake.com with your smartphone</li>
          <li>when Plancake receives updates and bug fixes, your smartphone will be able to use them immediately, no manual updating required! </li>
      </ul>
  </p>

<p>
Also, we wanted to keep Plancake Mobile quite simple because we believe a small smartphone screen is not the best option for organising your things as you would need a bigger picture and an easy drag and drop functionality to do so. What you would probably need is to jot down things as they come up to your mind, see what you need to buy at the grocery shop or check things off your lists.
