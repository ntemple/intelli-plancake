  <h4>Plancake Android app - deprecated</h4>
  <p>
      This is the Android application as it used to be found on the Android Market. Now users on Android are using our HTML5 web app. <br />
      You may want to study its code to learn how to synchronize a client application with the Plancake database.

      The extension is available on <a href="https://github.com/plancake/official-google-chrome-extension" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

  <h4>Plancake Web app</h4>

  <p>
  You can download Plancake and install it on your own <b>web server</b> but don''t forget you can simply <a href="%s">create an account</a> and start using Plancake for free without having to install, update or backup anything.
  </p>

  <p>
  Plancake is a PHP5/MySQL web application built on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.symfony-project.org/">Symfony</a>, the enterprise-level Object Oriented PHP Framework.
  </p>

  <p>
  To install Plancake on your server, there are some pre-requisites that are unfortunately <b>quite demanding</b> (please help us make the installation process easier):
  <ul>
  <li>the server has to run Linux</li>
  <li>MySQL database 4.0 or later</li>
  <li>Apache Web Server with mod_rewrite enabled</li>
  <li>PHP 5.2.4 or later</li>
  <li>you have to be able to set Apache Virtual hosts on the server</li>
  <li>you have to have SSH access to the server (if you don''t know what that means, I am afraid you will not be able to install Plancake)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Plancake API</h4>
  <p>
	We have decided to keep the code that powers our API closed for now because that is one of the most important assets of the Company.
  </p>

  <p>
	However we will be happy to provide the code to those developers who intend to contribute to the project and we feel we can trust.
