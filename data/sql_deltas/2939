      With Plancake Mobile we decided to go for an innovative route (by using HTML5) rather than building a native application for each smartphone operative system. <br />
      That way we can make improvements more quickly as we need to maintain only one codebase, as opposed to 4 or 5 of them.

    Plancake can be used in your browser even when an Internet connection is not available (thanks to HTML5). <br />
    That''s simply because you can use the mobile/smartphone application also with your desktop/laptop.

<p>
    Please bear in mind we have tested the offline application successfully on Google Chrome - some other browsers may not be supporting
    the new technologies we are leveraging yet.
</p>

<p>
    To use the offline application you just need to append <em>/mobile</em> to the address of your account.
</p>

<p>
    Your account URL: <br>
    <em>http://www.plancake,com/account.php</em>
</p>

<p>
    Offline application URL:<br />
    <em>http://www.plancake,com/account.php<b>/mobile</b></em>    
</p>

<p>
    The first time you reach the offline application (and after every time you clear your browser cache), your data
    will be synchronized and saved on your computer. From that moment on, your can use the mobile application even when offline. <br />
    <b>If you''re using a public or shared computer, don''t allow offline use.</b>
