Plancake Upgrade from the package
=================================

If you want to know the version you are on, please check this file (located in the root of the project):
version
or check the version number at the bottom of your account page

We will assume you installed Plancake in the directory /var/www/myplancake and
set up this domain for it: http://plancake.mywebsite.com

1 - Download the new package from http://www.plancake.com/open-source

2 - Backup your database and your files, just in case

3 - Take a note of the version number you are on (see the file 'version' in the root of your Plancake installation)

4 - Copy all the files and directories inside the 'plancake' directory you have just extracted to /var/www/myplancake (basically replace all
the old files with the new ones)

5 - Make sure you have ownership on the directories and files in /var/www/myplancake

6 - Make sure the file /var/www/myplancake/symfony is executable

7 - Delete all the files and directories inside /var/www/myplancake/cache

8 - From the directory /var/www/myplancake, run:
./symfony configure
That will ask you some questions in order to setup Plancake correctly

9 - From the directory /var/www/myplancake, run:
./symfony fix-perms

10 - You may need to upgrade your database. Check the file docs/DATABASE_CHANGELOG
and apply manually all the changes from the version you were on before this upgrade onwards.
