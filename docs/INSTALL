Plancake Installation
=====================

This software is meant to be installed on a Web Server (not on a desktop computer).
For more info: http://www.plancake.com

System Requirements
-------------------
_ SSL access to the server
_ MySQL database 4.0 or later with InnoDB Storage Engine
_ Apache with mod_rewrite enabled
_ PHP 5.2.4 or later
_ permission to set Apache Virtual hosts on the server


About the Software
-----------------
This is a PHP/MySQL application developed using the PHP framework Symfony (http://www.symfony-project.org/).
Despite of that, you don't need to know Symfony in order to install and use Plancake.


Installation
------------
We will assume you want to install Plancake in the directory /var/www/myplancake and
set up this domain for it: http://plancake.mywebsite.com

1 - Create an empty database using InnoDB as storage engine and utf8_general_ci as collation
(from mysql: CREATE DATABASE pancake DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;)

1.5 - Make sure the collation of the database is utf8_general_ci

2 - Download Plancake and extract it (probably you have already done that).

3 - Copy all the files and directories inside the 'plancake' directory you have just extracted to /var/www/myplancake

4 - Make sure you have ownership on the directories and files in /var/www/myplancake (use the 'chown -R' command)

5 - Run:  chmod +x /var/www/myplancake/symfony

6 - From the directory /var/www/myplancake, run:
./symfony configure
That will ask you some questions in order to setup Plancake correctly

7 - From the directory /var/www/myplancake, run:
./symfony install
That will create all the tables in the database.
(I had to install the xslt package: sudo apt-get install php5-xsl)

8 - From the directory /var/www/myplancake, run:
./symfony create-user [email_address] [password]
i.e.: ./symfony create-user me@mywebsite.com 45rerTo3

That will create the first user.
You can run this create-user command anytime you want to add a new user.
The user can also reset their password from the 'Settings' page on their Plancake account

9 - Now you just need to set the Apache Virtual Host to something like this (note the Documentroot ends with 'web'):
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
        ServerName http://plancake.mywebsite.com

        DocumentRoot /var/www/myplancake/web
        DirectoryIndex index.php

        <Directory />
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride None
        </Directory>

        <Directory "/var/www/myplancake/web">
                AllowOverride All
                Allow from All
        </Directory>

        AddDefaultCharset UTF-8

        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/plancake-error.log
        CustomLog /var/log/apache2/plancake-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

10 - Reload Apache

Congratulation! You are ready to go. Visit http://plancake.mywebsite.com and login

We would like this installation to be simpler, a-la-Wordpress: you upload all
the files in a directory and launch a web installer, without having to fiddle
with the Apache config file.
If you would like to contribute some of your time on this improvement, please contact me:

Troubleshooting
---------------
Have you got problems? Double check the permissions of the files. Is mod_rewrite enabled in Apache?

Setup of the email-to-inbox component
-------------------------------------
So far you have installed the Plancake web application - you can add/edit tasks/lists
via your Web browser.

This set up is quite difficult because involves changing the configuration of Postfix.
Please contact me if you would like to contribute some of your time to make this feature
work using POP3 or IMAP protocol:
dan@plancake.com

You may also want to set up the gorgeous :-) email-to-inbox component
on your server.
That will allow you to add tasks to your Inbox via emails sent to your Plancake email address.
Now the bad news: it will not be easy at all. But for any problem, you can ask
help on the forum.

To find out what your Plancake email address is, just go to the 'Settings' area of your account.
It will be something like:
inbox_xxxxxxx_5434@plancake.mywebsite.com
The important part is what comes before the '@' sign. In fact, the domain is not that important, as
it will depend on your Postfix configuration.
At the end of these configuration steps, you will be able to send emails to
inbox_xxxxxxx_5434@domain_you_set_up_on_postfix.

The only Plancake file you need to edit is config/app.yml. Search for 'emailToInbox' in that
file and edit the three values that come straight after.
The rest is Postfix and cron configuration. That requires good system administrator skills.

For the email-to-inbox feature we are not using any POP3 server. Instead, we are reading
the incoming emails locally on the filesystem of the server (as they are regular files).
To achieve that, we are using Postfix as SMTP server using the Maildir format
(that basically means storing each email in a different file).

All the steps to replicate our setup are as follows.
We will assume you have edited your app.yml as follows:

inboxUser: catchall
incomingEmailsDirectory: /var/spool/mail/catchall
mailServerDomain: mywebsite.com

and that you are installing Postfix from scratch on a RedHat machine with IP 1.2.3.4

1 _ setup this DNS record to be able to receive the emails to your domain
MX 10 mywebsite.com

2 _ make sure the hostname of the server is something like
server.mywebsite.com

3 _ make sure in /etc/hosts there is something like this
127.0.0.1  server.mywebsite.com server localhost localhost.localdomain

4 _ uninstall sendmail (that should be installed as default MTA)
/etc/init.d/sendmail stop
yum remove sendmail

5 _ install Postfix
yum install postfix

6 _ edit /etc/postfix/main.cf:
myhostname = server.mywebsite.com
mydomain = mywebsite.com
myorigin = mywebsite.com
inet_interfaces = all
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost, $mydomain
mail_spool_directory = /var/spool/mail/

7 _ In /etc/postfix/main.cf add
luser_relay = catchall
local_recipient_maps =

8 _ create a local catchall user
/usr/sbin/useradd -g users -s /bin/bash catchall

9 _ set a password for it
passwd catchall

10 _ add the catchall user to the apache group
/usr/sbin/usermod -Gapache catchall

11 _ rm /var/spool/mail/catchall

12 _ mkdir -p /var/spool/mail/catchall/cur

13 _ mkdir /var/spool/mail/catchall/new

14 _ mkdir /var/spool/mail/catchall/tmp

15 _ chown -R catchall.mail /var/spool/mail/catchall/

16 _ chmod -R 770 /var/spool/mail/catchall/

17 _ chown catchall.users /var/spool/mail/catchall/cur/

18 _ chown catchall.users /var/spool/mail/catchall/new

19 _ /etc/init.d/postfix start

20 _ double check the 'emailToInbox' section in config/app.yml reflects your
Postfix settings

21 _ Add this cronjob (change the path to symfony accordingly to your set up):
*/3 * * * * catchall /var/www/myplancake/symfony cron:check-email-to-inbox --env=prod



Troubleshooting the email-to-inbox component
--------------------------------------------
Probably you will not get this component to work in the first attempt.
The causes of the problem can be basically two:
a) issue with delivering emails to your server (the more likely)
b) issue with parsing the emails by Plancake

So first of all, you have to make sure the issue is not a).
_ When you send an email to your Plancake email address (i.e. inbox_myname_4325@plancake.mywebsite.com)
can you see a new file in the /var/spool/mail/catchall/new directory of the catchall user?
_ If not, when you send an email directly to your catchall user (i.e. catchall@plancake.mywebsite.com)
can you see a new file in the /var/spool/mail/catchall/new directory of the catchall user?

If a) is not the problem, then it should be b).
Try to run
/var/www/myplancake/symfony cron:check-email-to-inbox --env=prod
and check the debug output. You can post it on the forum. We will be glad to
help you.
